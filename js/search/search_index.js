built using NestJS that allows users to create, update, and manage tasks within projects. Users can be assigned different roles such as Admin, Project Manager, or Team Member, each with different permissions. The API also supports real-time task updates using WebSockets and email notifications for task assignment and status changes.\n\nFeatures\n\nUser Authentication: Register, login, and manage user sessions using JWT-based authentication.\nRole-Based Access Control (RBAC): Admins, Project Managers, and Team Members with different access levels.\nTask Management: Create, update, delete, and assign tasks to users within projects.\nProject Management: Organize tasks into projects for better task categorization.\nReal-time Notifications: Get notified of task updates (e.g., status changes) in real-time using WebSockets.\nEmail Notifications: Receive email notifications when tasks are assigned or updated.\nScalable Architecture: Neon (PostgreSQL)\nNeon offers a free PostgreSQL database with 10,000 requests per month, 3 GB of data storage, and free scaling.\n  Setup Steps:\nSign up for Neon.\nCreate a new PostgreSQL database instance.\nGet the connection string from Neon, and use it in your .env file (DATABASE_URL).\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnologies\n\nNestJS: Node.js framework for building efficient, scalable applications.\nTypeORM: ORM for database interactions with support for PostgreSQL or MySQL.\nPassport.js: Authentication middleware for handling JWT-based auth.\nWebSockets: Real-time communication for task updates.\nNodemailer: For sending email notifications.\nDeployment for Backend (NestJS API)\n\nCI/CD Pipeline\nThis project uses a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to ensure code quality, test coverage, and seamless deployments.\nPipeline Overview\n\nGitHub Actions:\nTriggers on every push or pull request to the main branch.\nRuns the following checks:\nLinting: Ensures code consistency with ESLint.\nUnit Tests: Runs unit tests and uploads coverage reports to\n CodeCov.\n\n\n\n2. SonarCloud: \n\nAnalyzes code for potential bugs, vulnerabilities,     * and maintainability issues.\nBuild & Deploy: Builds the application and deploys it to the production environment.\n\n3. SonarCloud:\n\nIntegrates with GitHub Actions to perform static code analysis.\nEnforces quality gates to ensure high code quality.\nScans for bugs, security vulnerabilities, and code smells.\n\n\nCodeCov:\n\nMeasures and tracks test coverage.\nReports coverage results directly in pull requests to ensure sufficient code coverage.\nA badge is included in the README to display current coverage status.\n\n\nNeon PostgreSQL:\n\nFree-tier PostgreSQL database used for production.\nMigrations are automatically applied after deployment.\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\nTo run this project locally, ensure you have the following installed:\n\nNode.js (v16+)\nPostgreSQL or MySQL database\nYarn or npm (Yarn is preferred)\n\nGetting Started\n1. Clone the Repository\nExample :git clone https://github.com/yourusername/task-management-api.git\ncd task-management-api2. Install Dependencies\nExample :yarn install3. Set Up Environment Variables\nCreate a .env (see .env.example) file in the project root and add the following variables:\nExample :# Database configuration\nDATABASE_HOST=localhost\nDATABASE_PORT=5432\nDATABASE_USER=your_db_user\nDATABASE_PASSWORD=your_db_password\nDATABASE_NAME=task_management_db\n\n# JWT Secret\nJWT_SECRET=your_secret_key\n\n# Email configuration (for Nodemailer)\nEMAIL_HOST=smtp.example.com\nEMAIL_PORT=587\nEMAIL_USER=your_email@example.com\nEMAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_password\n\n# WebSocket settings\nWEBSOCKET_PORT=30014. Set Up the Database\nEnsure that you have PostgreSQL or MySQL running, then run migrations to set up the database schema:\nExample :yarn typeorm migration:run5. Start the Server\nExample :yarn start:dev6. Build documentationn\nExample :yarn run docs6. Build documentationn\nExample :yarn serve-docsAPI Documentation\nYou can explore the API documentation by visiting http://localhost:3000/api after starting the server. The documentation is auto-generated using Swagger.\nKey Endpoints\n\nAuthentication\n\nPOST /auth/signup: Register a new user\nPOST /auth/login: Authenticate and obtain a JWT token\n\n\nUsers\n\nGET /users: Get all users (Admin access required)\nGET /users/:id: Get a user by ID\nPATCH /users/:id: Update user information (Admin/Project Manager)\n\n\nProjects\n\nGET /projects: Get all projects\nPOST /projects: Create a new project (Admin/Project Manager)\nPATCH /projects/:id: Update project details (Admin/Project Manager)\n\n\nTasks\n\nGET /tasks: Get all tasks for the current user\nPOST /tasks: Create a new task (Admin/Project Manager)\nPATCH /tasks/:id: Update task status, assignment, etc. (Admin/Project Manager)\n\n\nWebSockets\n\nReal-time updates are pushed to subscribed users when task statuses change or new tasks are assigned.\n\n\nTests\nTo run tests, execute:\nExample :\nyarn testFuture Improvements\n\nFile Attachments: Support file uploads and attachments to tasks.\nAnalytics Dashboard: Provide project managers with a dashboard to track task completion rates, project statuses, etc.\nPush Notifications: Add support for mobile push notifications.\n\nContributing\nContributions are welcome! Please follow these steps:\n\nFork the repository.\n\nCreate a new feature branch (git checkout -b feature/your-feature).\n\nCommit your changes (git commit -m 'Add some feature').\n\nPush to the branch (git push origin feature/your-feature).\n\nOpen a pull request.\n\nLicense\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE file for details.\n\n\nContact\nFor any questions, feel free to contact the project maintainer at your_email@example.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2024 Jordach Makaya\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
