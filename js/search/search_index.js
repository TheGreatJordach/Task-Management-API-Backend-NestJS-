Users can be assigned different roles such as Admin, Project Manager, or Team Member, each with different permissions. The API also supports real-time task updates using WebSockets and email notifications for task assignment and status changes.\n\nFeatures\n\nUser Authentication: Register, login, and manage user sessions using JWT-based authentication.\nRole-Based Access Control (RBAC): Admins, Project Managers, and Team Members with different access levels.\nTask Management: Create, update, delete, and assign tasks to users within projects.\nProject Management: Organize tasks into projects for better task categorization.\nReal-time Notifications: Get notified of task updates (e.g., status changes) in real-time using WebSockets.\nEmail Notifications: Receive email notifications when tasks are assigned or updated.\nScalable Architecture: Neon (PostgreSQL)\nNeon offers a free PostgreSQL database with 10,000 requests per month, 3 GB of data storage, and free scaling.\n  Setup Steps:\nSign up for Neon.\nCreate a new PostgreSQL database instance.\nGet the connection string from Neon, and use it in your .env file (DATABASE_URL).\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnologies\n\nNestJS: Node.js framework for building efficient, scalable applications.\nTypeORM: ORM for database interactions with support for PostgreSQL or MySQL.\nPassport.js: Authentication middleware for handling JWT-based auth.\nWebSockets: Real-time communication for task updates.\nNodemailer: For sending email notifications.\nDeployment for Backend (NestJS API)\n\nCI/CD Pipeline\nThis project uses a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to ensure code quality, test coverage, and seamless deployments.\nPipeline Overview\n\nGitHub Actions:\nTriggers on every push or pull request to the main branch.\nRuns the following checks:\nLinting: Ensures code consistency with ESLint.\nUnit Tests: Runs unit tests and uploads coverage reports to\n CodeCov.\n\n\n\n2. SonarCloud: \n\nAnalyzes code for potential bugs, vulnerabilities,     * and maintainability issues.\nBuild & Deploy: Builds the application and deploys it to the production environment.\n\n3. SonarCloud:\n\nIntegrates with GitHub Actions to perform static code analysis.\nEnforces quality gates to ensure high code quality.\nScans for bugs, security vulnerabilities, and code smells.\n\n\nCodeCov:\n\nMeasures and tracks test coverage.\nReports coverage results directly in pull requests to ensure sufficient code coverage.\nA badge is included in the README to display current coverage status.\n\n\nNeon PostgreSQL:\n\nFree-tier PostgreSQL database used for production.\nMigrations are automatically applied after deployment.\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\nTo run this project locally, ensure you have the following installed:\n\nNode.js (v16+)\nPostgreSQL or MySQL database\nYarn or npm (Yarn is preferred)\n\nGetting Started\n1. Clone the Repository\nExample :git clone https://github.com/yourusername/task-management-api.git\ncd task-management-api2. Install Dependencies\nExample :yarn install3. Set Up Environment Variables\nCreate a .env (see .env.example) file in the project root and add the following variables:\nExample :# Database configuration\nDATABASE_HOST=localhost\nDATABASE_PORT=5432\nDATABASE_USER=your_db_user\nDATABASE_PASSWORD=your_db_password\nDATABASE_NAME=task_management_db\n\n# JWT Secret\nJWT_SECRET=your_secret_key\n\n# Email configuration (for Nodemailer)\nEMAIL_HOST=smtp.example.com\nEMAIL_PORT=587\nEMAIL_USER=your_email@example.com\nEMAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_password\n\n# WebSocket settings\nWEBSOCKET_PORT=30014. Set Up the Database\nEnsure that you have PostgreSQL or MySQL running, then run migrations to set up the database schema:\nExample :yarn typeorm migration:run5.
