# Suggested Plan
## Phase 1: Setup & Authentication

* 1.1. **Set up the project** structure and initial configurations.
* 1.2. **Implement the Authentication Module.**
    * Create the AuthService for registration and login.
    * Set up JWT token generation and validation.
    * Write unit tests for authentication logic.

## Phase 2: Core Modules

* 2.1. Implement the Users Module.
    * Develop endpoints for fetching and updating users.
    * Integrate role-based access control (RBAC).
    * Write unit tests for user operations.
* 2.2. Implement the Projects Module.
    * Develop endpoints for managing projects.
    * Ensure proper access control for project management.
    * Write unit tests for project operations.
* 2.3. Implement the Tasks Module.
    * Develop endpoints for task management.
    * Integrate with the Projects Module for task organization.
    * Write unit tests for task operations.

## Phase 3: Real-time Features
* 3.1. Implement the WebSocket Module.
    * Set up real-time updates for task changes.
    * Write integration tests for WebSocket functionality.
    
## Phase 4: Notifications

* 4.1. Implement the Email Notifications Module.
* Set up email sending for task assignments/updates.
* Integrate with existing task management functionality.
* Write integration tests for email notifications.

## Phase 5: Integration & Deployment

* 5.1. Integrate all modules and ensure seamless interaction.
* 5.2. Set up continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) pipelines.
* 5.3. Configure Codecov for coverage reports and integrate with GitHub Actions.
* 5.4. Perform end-to-end testing and resolve any issues.

## Phase 6: Scalability & Final Touches

* 6.1. Review and optimize performance, focusing on scalability with Neon PostgreSQL.
* 6.2. Finalize documentation and update the README file.
* 6.3. Conduct a final review of code and features before deployment.

* Additional Notes
* Documentation: Ensure that each module has clear documentation for both API endpoints and internal logic.
* Security: Implement robust security measures, especially around authentication and sensitive data.
* Testing: Prioritize writing comprehensive tests (unit, integration, and end-to-end) for all modules.
* Scalability: Regularly review and test the scalability of the application, particularly with the PostgreSQL database.

By following this plan, we'll systematically build out your Task Management system, ensuring that each component is robust and integrates well with the others.
