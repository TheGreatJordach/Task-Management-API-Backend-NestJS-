    * GET /users
    * GET /users/:id
    * PATCH /users/:id
* Features:
    * Fetch all users (admin access)
    * Fetch user by ID
    * Update user information (admin/project manager)

3. Projects Module 

* Endpoints:
    * GET /projects
    * POST /projects
    * PATCH /projects/:id
* Features:
    * Fetch all projects
    * Create a new project (admin/project manager)
    * Update project details (admin/project manager)
 
4. **Tasks Module [lazy Loaded]**

* Endpoints:
    * GET /tasks
    * POST /tasks
    * PATCH /tasks/:id
* Features:
    * Fetch all tasks for the current user
    * Create a new task (admin/project manager)
    * Update task status/assignment (admin/project manager)

5. **WebSocket Module  [lazy Loaded]**

* Features:
    * Real-time updates on task status changes
    * Real-time notifications for new task assignments

6.Email Notifications Module  [lazy Loaded]

* Features:
    * Send email notifications for task assignments/updates



## Why Lazy Loading is a Good Fit?

Lazy loading the **Task, WebSocket, and Email** modules

* **Tasks** may not be required until a user interacts with the system after logging in or when project management activities occur.
* Lazy loading ensures that the Task module is only initialized when needed, reducing memory overhead and improving startup times.
* **WebSocket connections consume resources**, and initializing them upfront can burden the application if unnecessary for all users.
* L**azy loading can prevent initializing the email infrastructure** (SMTP connections, template rendering engines) when they are not immediately required


### How to Implement Lazy Loading in NestJS:

```sh
// Example for lazy loading the Task module
@Controller('tasks')
export class TaskController {
  @Get()
  async getTasks() {
    const { TaskService } = await import('./task/task.service');
    return new TaskService().findAll();
  }
}

```

### Considerations for Lazy Loading in Production-Ready Applications:
#### Module Dependencies:

* Ensure that the lazy-loaded modules don’t have deep interdependencies with other core modules. If a lazy-loaded module is dependent on another module that’s already loaded, it might negate the benefits of lazy loading. 

#### Error Handling:
* Since lazy loading introduces dynamic imports and delayed initialization, it’s important to have robust error handling. If a module fails to load or initialize (e.g., the WebSocket service is unavailable), the app should gracefully recover.
#### Testing and CI/CD Pipeline:
* Lazy loading can introduce more complexity in testing. Ensure that your CI/CD pipeline has tests that cover lazy-loaded modules to verify they initialize and work correctly under different scenarios.
#### Impact on Monitoring:
* With modules being loaded at different times, monitoring and logging systems should be configured to detect when these modules start and load dynamically. This will help in debugging issues in production.
